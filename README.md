### __This project was made in 2018. So, it needs a lot of enhancements:__

1- Object detection is using darkflow (https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) which uses YOLOv1. Implementing YOLOv4 will surely give better results.

2- Using GPU instead of CPU.

3- Cleaning the code and using more classes.
